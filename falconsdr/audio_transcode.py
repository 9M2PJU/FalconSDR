"""Optional WAV -> MP3 transcode, run only after a recording has been fully
written and closed (see recorder.py / scanner_engine.py's finish-line call
sites) - never on the real-time recording path itself, per this project's own
long-standing rule (a transcode is a whole-file operation; doing it per-chunk
would be both pointless and slow).

``ffmpeg``: a system one on PATH wins, otherwise the binary shipped in the
``imageio-ffmpeg`` pip package (requirements.txt) - so MP3 also works in the
packaged builds with nothing installed. Still degrades gracefully: with no
ffmpeg at all, the WAV is simply left in place rather than the recording
being lost or the scanner failing.
